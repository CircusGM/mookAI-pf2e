# mookAI-pf2e

This module extends the mookAI module to work with the Pathfinder 2e system. Providing basic automation of move and strike actions with correct number of actions split between the two.

Make sure to set the MookAI module configuration to use the PF2E distance metric.

See the [mookAI](https://github.com/CircusGM/mookAI-12) module for more information.
